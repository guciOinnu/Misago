# Evangelion 3.33 Dub Online: The Lost and Found Story of the Original Dub
  
Evangelion 3.33: You Can (Not) Redo is the third film in the Rebuild of Evangelion series, a reboot of the classic anime Neon Genesis Evangelion. The film was released in Japan in 2012, but it took four years for it to reach the English-speaking audience on Blu-ray and DVD. Why? Because the original English dub that was shown in theaters in 2014 was scrapped and redone by Studio Khara, the Japanese production company behind the Rebuild series. But what happened to the original dub? And how did it resurface online after years of being lost?
  
## The Original Dub for Evangelion 3.33
  
The original dub for Evangelion 3.33 was produced by Funimation, the same company that dubbed the previous two Rebuild films and the original TV series. The dub featured most of the same voice actors from the previous dubs, such as Spike Spencer as Shinji Ikari, Tiffany Grant as Asuka Langley Shikinami, and Allison Keith as Misato Katsuragi. The dub premiered at New York Comic Con in December 2013, where members of Studio Khara were in attendance. The dub also had a limited theatrical release in January 2014, distributed by Eleven Arts.

However, something went wrong between Funimation and Studio Khara after the theatrical release. According to Funimation, Studio Khara requested changes to the dub script and voice direction after reviewing the final product. Funimation agreed to comply with Khara's wishes and reworked the dub from scratch. This caused a delay in the home video release of Evangelion 3.33, which was originally scheduled for February 2014. The new dub was finally released on Blu-ray and DVD in February 2016, two years after the theatrical release.

## The Differences Between the Original Dub and the New Dub
  
The new dub for Evangelion 3.33 is not just a minor revision of the original dub. It is a completely different dub with different scripts, voice performances, and even some different voice actors. For example, Brina Palencia replaced Trina Nishimura as Mari Makinami Illustrious, and Jerry Jewell replaced Greg Ayres as Kensuke Aida.
  
The new dub also changed some of the dialogue and terminology to match Khara's vision for the film. For example, some of the names of the Evas and Angels were changed to reflect their Japanese pronunciations, such as "Mark.06" instead of "Mark Six" and "Nebuchadnezzar's Key" instead of "Nebuchadnezzar's Key". Some of the dialogue was also altered to be more faithful to the Japanese script or to convey a different tone or emotion. For example, Shinji's line "I don't care about this world anymore" was changed to "I don't want anything to do with this world anymore" in the new dub.
  
The differences between the original dub and the new dub are not just cosmetic. They affect how the audience perceives the characters and their motivations, as well as how they interpret the themes and messages of the film. Some fans prefer the original dub for its familiarity and consistency with the previous dubs, while others prefer the new dub for its accuracy and clarity with Khara's vision.
  
## How Was The Original Dub Found?
  
For a long time, fans thought that the original dub for Evangelion 3.33 was lost forever, since it was only ever released in theaters and never on home video. However, in March 2023, a Twitter user named @pkmncrystalVEVO announced that they had found the original dub and promptly released it to the web. But how did they find something that had eluded even the most committed Eva fans for years?
  
According to @pkmncrystalVEVO, they purchased a screener DVD on eBay that contained the original dub. A screener DVD is a promotional copy of a film that is sent to critics or distributors before its official release. Despite damages to the disk and without even knowing for sure that it had the original dub on it, they
