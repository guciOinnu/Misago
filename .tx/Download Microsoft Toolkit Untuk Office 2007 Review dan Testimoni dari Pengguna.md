If you are looking for a way to activate Microsoft Office 2007 without a product key, you may want to try Microsoft Toolkit. Microsoft Toolkit is a set of tools and functions that can manage licensing, deploying, and activating Microsoft Office and Windows. In this article, we will show you how to download Microsoft Toolkit for Office 2007 and use it to activate your Office suite.
 
## What is Microsoft Toolkit?
 
Microsoft Toolkit is a free software that can activate Microsoft Office and Windows products. It works by using a technique called Key Management Service (KMS), which is a technology that allows organizations to activate their software products over a local network. Microsoft Toolkit can emulate a KMS server on your computer and send activation requests to it, bypassing the need for a genuine product key.

It supports Office 2010 or later versions, and Windows Vista or later versions. However, it does not support Office 365 or Windows 10 S mode.
